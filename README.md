## ðŸš€ About Me
HelloðŸ‘‹! My name is Petar Stoev and I'm a Web Developer.

I started working on my first website when I was in high school. Ever since then, I've loved learning how to use the latest technology to create websites that make people's lives easier.

I've been working with computers since the age of 9. I love learning new things and pushing myself to learn more about the field of web development. That's why I'm always looking for ways to improve myself as a developer.

In my spare time, you can find me playing video games, watching movies, cooking, or reading books!

I'm always up for meeting new people and hearing what they're passionate about. If you want to connect with me feel free to DM me on Instagram or check out my LinkedIn profile.
